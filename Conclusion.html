    <p class="w3-justify">Today, Netflix has taken the world by storm. Due to the convenience of its services and their exclusive quality media productions and/or content, its popularity is increasing by the minute – new subscribers keep coming. In some households, it even has become a staple, a necessity – it has its share of the monthly budget, just like water, electric, and internet bills. Given these reasons, there’s no doubt that Netflix and similar streaming platforms disrupted and are currently disrupting the balance in the world of media.</p>
    <p class="w3-justify">Although it has its pros, with convenience as its main desirable aspect (streaming anytime, anywhere), it has been mentioned that its downside includes the “expiry” or removal of some of the content in their platform after some time. If one of their exclusive contents gets removed or becomes unavailable on their platform, there won’t be any legal way to view that content any longer, unless it has been bought or licensed by another platform. Furthermore, Netflix currently doesn’t offer any live streaming service that television and other platforms such as YouTube and Facebook have. However, Netflix might address these weaknesses in the future, or if they move too slowly, they can be overtaken by another technology that would be developed in the future.</p>
    <p class="w3-justify">Our world, both physical and digital/virtual, has its life cycle. The old gets replaced by the new, and only a few get to withstand the test of time due to its “timelessness” or by gaining loyal audiences or customers. To survive, it is essential to adapt, evolve, and learn to address the weaknesses of a product, service, or technology.  What we may know today as disruptors will eventually become the norm, and there will be a rise of newer technologies that will then become the new “disruptors.”</p>
