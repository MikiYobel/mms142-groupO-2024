    <p class="w3-justify">Streaming services such as Netflix have streamlined the watching experience for the average viewer: a plethora of different series, movies, and documentaries all on a single platform that’s curated to your taste. Catalogs allow you to search media up by specific genres, while you could personally press “like” on a certain media to let the algorithm know that you like this specific kind of movie and will recommend you things related to it. However, as you use the service, you’ll find a tag on some movies saying that it’ll be available up until a certain time or it’ll be removed at a certain date. Once that media is gone from Netflix, what now?
    </p>
    <p class="w3-justify">The rise of streaming services has indeed made consumption of media much more readily available, but as Kelly (2022) says, it only exacerbates the ephemerality of media in the digital age, leading to what is known as the “digital dark age.” The digital dark age, as coined by Kuny (1997), is considered an age where media stored digitally is much more temporary compared to its analogue counterparts. Though it’s agreed upon that streaming services have a large library of content ranging from vintage to recent, content can be removed from the platform with little to no notice thanks to a plethora of reasons such as a license expiring, a new license being formed with another streaming service, or for apparently no reason at all, as seen with the sudden removal of Cartoon Network shows from HBO Max back in 2022 (Larrimore, 2024).
    </p>
    <p class="w3-justify">Once a piece of media is taken off from a certain streaming service such as Netflix, there’s a chance it might reappear in another streaming service thanks to a new license. This, however, leads to the consumer to subscribe to yet another streaming service, an added expense, on top of the one they’re already using just to rewatch it—and that’s the best case scenario. Some content, such as originals produced for the streaming services, may simply disappear for good when it’s removed, while other content might never even make it into streaming services to begin with thanks to ownership and licensing issues. An example one can look to is Looking for Mr. Goodbar, a 1977 movie with no legal way to stream it thanks to an issue with its music rights.
    </p>
    <p class="w3-justify">Physical media such as DVDs still exist and they are still used to preserve media, but they are most commonly purchased by people who intend to keep them as collections in this modern era. In addition, the average price of a DVD is around 44 USD (2600 PHP) per disc, which contributes to its rarity considering that a person can purchase a streaming service for more than half its price (Holder, 2024). As a result, physical media stores in North America began announcing bankruptcy, with big names such as Best Buy even announcing their cease of sales of DVDs last October 2023 (Spangler, 2023). Due to the rise of streaming services paired with their cheaper price, the popularity of physical media suffered a great decline.</p>
