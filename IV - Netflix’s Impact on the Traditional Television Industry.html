    <p class="w3-justify">The popularity of streaming platforms, including Netflix, contributed to the disruption of the traditional television industry, giving way to a new era of media consumption, and one such effect is that cable subscriptions have now declined. Most viewers canceled their cable subscriptions in favor of the more affordable, more flexible options available on streaming platforms such as Netflix (Al Jazeera, 2024). Because of such a significant demand for streaming, it’s become a struggle for cable providers to raise revenues and customer base. This shift in viewer behavior has forced traditional television providers to adapt their business models to remain competitive in the evolving media landscape (Sanusi & Ola, 2023). </p>
    <p class="w3-justify">One of the ways traditional television networks have adapted is by launching their own streaming services. Peacock, Disney+, and Max (formerly HBO Max) are the platforms major film companies such as NBCUniversal, Disney, and Warner Media introduced respectively in an attempt to compete in the market. They offer similar services to Netflix in terms of a library while simultaneously trying to maintain a brand identity of their own and content control over their original programming.</p>
    <p class="w3-justify">Netflix continues to be a dominant force in the industry despite the competition, however. What the other streaming platforms offers are first provided by Netflix in the first place, whether it be a vast selection of movies and television shows, accessibility in multiple devices, or personalized experience—not just in recommendations but also in viewing settings (e.g. video quality, subtitles, and audio tracks). This remains a permanent reminder that on-demand viewing is how Netflix forever changed how content is made, marketed, delivered to, and consumed by audiences.
    </p>
    <p class="w3-justify">Another way Netflix impacted the traditional television industry is through bypassing traditional distribution channels. The company applied a direct-to-consumer model, which allowed both parties to build a direct relationship. This, in turn, allowed the streaming platform to garner valuable data on the viewer’s preferences and usage patterns (Guadiana, 2020). This is significantly valuable in the process of content production since this ensures the company that what they are creating has an audience that will watch. Furthermore, it is because of this model that the platform managed to create shows that fostered the popularity of the binge-watching culture, where finished seasons of a series are released at once, enabling viewers to consume content in one-sitting, almost as if on a marathon (Boulgaz, 2022).</p>
