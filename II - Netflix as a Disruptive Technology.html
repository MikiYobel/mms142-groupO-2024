    <P  class="w3-justify">Netflix continued to evolve and by 2013, they ventured into original content production. The streaming platform transitioned from a distributor into a creator of original entertainment with the release of House of Cards, its first major success. It started to create high-quality TV series and movies, breaking the mold of traditional networks that relied on outside studios. Hits like Stranger Things and The Crown soon followed, showing that Netflix was here to stay—not just as a streaming platform, but as a major content creator, giving traditional studios serious competition. </P>
    <P  class="w3-justify">Netflix is considered a global phenomenon, spanning dominion over 190 countries. It is a household name among other streaming platforms and studios, offering a diverse catalog of content tailored to a worldwide audience. Netflix’s journey from being a DVD rental into being a powerhouse in the entertainment industry highlights utmost innovation and adaptability, especially in a field considered highly competitive.

        Several standout features made Netflix the success and fan-favorite streaming platform it is now:    
        <ul>
            <li class="w3-left-align">On-Demand Streaming: Unlike traditional TV, Netflix puts its viewers in control as they are free to watch content whenever they please without the need to wait for a certain time or date to catch the next episode of a show. The audience is also given the liberty to choose films they want to watch rather than viewing whatever movie is currently on air.</li>
            <li class="w3-left-align">Personalized Recommendations: Netflix’s algorithm tailors recommendations of shows or movies based on what an individual has already viewed. This allows said individual to discover new content that aligns with their personal preference.</li>
            <li class="w3-left-align">Original Content: Netflix has become known for its original programming, other features. They allot a massive budget for the creation of original content, whether it be shows or films, that can further solidify their standing as a studio capable of competing with other film studios and television channels. Content like Rebel Moon and Stranger Things are only some of their original programs.</li>
            <li class="w3-left-align">Access on Multiple Devices: Netflix’s compatibility with various devices ensures a seamless viewing experience and that viewers can easily switch between gadgets, whether it be a smart TV, laptop, or smartphone, without losing progress of where they’ve left off.</li>
            <li class="w3-left-align">Minimal Ads: Regardless of the variety in terms of plan offers, Netflix’s subscription-based model grants ad-free viewing to most users.</li>
        </ul>
    <P  class="w3-justify">Netflix offers several subscription options to cater to different viewing habits and budgets. The Basic plan (249 PHP / month) lets you stream on one device at a time in standard definition. The Standard plan (399 PHP / month) allows two simultaneous streams in HD, while the Premium plan (549 PHP / month) offers 4K streaming on up to four devices at once (Netfix, n.d.). In 2022, Netflix introduced an Ad-Supported plan for those who want to save a little money while watching ads during their content. Unlike traditional TV, which often requires expensive cable packages bundled with channels you might not want, Netflix lets you pick the plan that suits your needs without locking you into long-term contracts. You can cancel or change your plan whenever you want, giving you much more flexibility than traditional television services.</P>
    <P  class="w3-justify">The experience of consuming and delivering entertainment media is the most notable distinction between Netflix and traditional television. While the latter relies on scheduled programming, Netflix gives its viewers the chance to watch all their available content anytime, anywhere. </P>
    <p  class="w3-justify">Pricing is another notable difference between the two. While traditional TV requires a viewer to subscribe to a cable bundled with numerous channels, some of which are often unwatched, Netflix offers a more straightforward subscription model that doesn’t discuss long-term commitments. Moreover, traditional networks rely on advertisements for revenue whereas the streaming platform highlights their ad-free plan along with their lower-cost ad-supported plan.</p>
    <p  class="w3-justify">While traditional television guarantees multiple shows and films at one’s disposal as well, there’s no guarantee that what the viewer is watching is their preference because they aren’t given the liberty to choose their content. On the other hand, Netflix’s content library is also vast, with numerous movies, documentaries, and TV series—including original programming—available on-demand.</p>
