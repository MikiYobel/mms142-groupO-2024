    <p class="w3-justify">Disruptive technologies are products of innovation, changing consumer behavior, business processes, and industries’ systems (Smith, 2022). The term “Disruptive Technology” was coined by the late Clayton Christensen– a Professor in Business Administration and an author– in 1995. He developed the theory of disruptive innovation, which is introducing a product or service to a particular target market that eventually “disrupts” the mainstream market (Christensen et al., 2015). This theory explains how to produce disruptive technologies and when a technology becomes disruptive.</p>
    <p class="w3-justify">Professor Christensen further expounded this theory in his book “The Innovation Dilemma”. According to him, there are two kinds of technologies: disruptive and sustaining (Christensen, 2016).</p>
    <p class="w3-justify">Sustaining technologies focus on growing existing technologies from established businesses. This technology relies on innovating by enhancing features of current technologies without completely changing them. For instance, Facebook, an established social media platform, effectively maintains its relevance by consistently updating its features and functionality for over two decades. Thus, its innovations would be regarded as sustainable technologies.</p>
    <p class="w3-justify">On the other hand, disruptive technologies are innovations that change the landscape of an industry or even entirely make a new one. These technologies develop new systems for a new class of target audience. One notable example of a disruptive technology is phone banking. Online banking companies such as G-Cash and Maya started to emerge, creating a new mode of payment other than cards and cash. This technology changes the landscape of financial services and transactions.</p>
    <p class="w3-justify">Some technologies that are considered common today were once disruptive technologies. Televisions, the internet, and cars were once regarded as disruptive technologies. Television drastically changed the entertainment industry, the internet altered the flow of information, and cars enhanced the mode of transportation. These innovations that currently rely on sustainable technologies were formerly disruptive when they were developed.</p>
    <p class="w3-justify">Nowadays, many start-ups actively attempt to build a disruptive technology that will challenge the mainstream market in their respective niches. While not all businesses succeed, some technologies still manage to create a disruptive innovation–especially in digital media– such as TikTok for social media, ChatGPT for AI, and Netflix for the film industry.</p>
