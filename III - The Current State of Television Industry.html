    <p class="w3-justify">Before the emergence of internet streaming services like Netflix, traditional television was the typical entertainment source for most households (Andrews, 2021). Programming schedules determine when a viewer can watch their favorite show, requiring them to adjust their daily schedules. Cable TV is accessed through a large variety of channels, but the diversity is narrowed down due to the regional broadcasting rights and time slots. With advertising revenue, networks could survive on the income from commercials inserted throughout programming. Such a model functioned for a multitude of years, yet it heavily assumed audiences would remain rigid in their viewing schedule and would not mind whenever an advertisement interrupted a show or program.
    </p>
    <p class="w3-justify">However, there is more to the challenge that awaits the old television industry than the competition posed by streaming services like Netflix. Cable subscriptions have been dropping in a phenomenon that has come to be known as "cord-cutting" whereby the younger generation of consumers are cutting it off in favor of cheaper internet-based alternatives. Media globalization also presents a challenge, as audiences can now easily enjoy international content, which can be full of fresh perspectives and storytelling styles. Moreover, viewers have grown to dislike ads and consume media only as part of an unbroken experience. Today, with audiences segmented across many platforms, it is even harder for the old traditional TV networks to garner those big monolithic audiences than they used to be.
    </p>
    <p class="w3-justify">In the past few years, viewer behaviors and preferences have shifted significantly (Martlenz, n.d.). The binge-watching pattern has become prevalent, as the audience prefers to watch the whole series at once rather than waiting for episodic releases over a week. International dramas, true crime documentaries, and independent films are in high demand as well, especially for their diversity and quality. This is an aspect that streaming platforms excel in that traditional television struggles with because they are prone to target wider, less specific segments of audiences. Moreover, the increased use of devices for viewing has also contributed to the changes in behavior and preferences. Nowadays, televisions are mostly used for family viewing or live sports while individuals tend to watch on their gadgets out of portability and convenience. 
    </p>
    <p class="w3-justify">Flexibility is another factor in shift from the traditional television (Sandry, 2024). Audiences no longer want strict programming schedules and instead enjoy content at their convenience and on their schedule. Because of these features, including ad-free service and recommendation of content specific to individual viewers, platforms such as Netflix succeed. These offerings align perfectly with the needs of today’s viewers, making Netflix and similar platforms increasingly in demand.
    </p>
    <p class="w3-justify">The revamped tastes of viewers pose significant challenges to models anchored on traditional television. Such networks are struggling to meet the modern demands of audiences in terms of on-demand viewing, minimal congestion, and compatibility across devices when such competition is streaming platforms, which in this case is Netflix. Considering that expectations continue to evolve, traditional television’s best route is to turn to innovation so as not to face irrelevance in a rapidly transforming entertainment field.
