    <p class="w3-justify">Geography plays an integral role in terms of accessing digital resources, especially if efforts are toward making it more seamless and widespread. Netflix appeals more to an individual equipped with gadgets and high-speed internet at their disposal, displaying the benefits of accessibility and portability. Subscription video-on-demand services (SODs), which is what Netflix offers, significantly transformed the competitive market in transnational video distribution. As a result, content is now allowed for sharing across borders without the limitations of regional licensing agreements (Lotz, 2020). It is because of the company’s direct-to-consumer model and cloud computing that it is enabled to bypass traditional distribution channels in a way that cables and satellite TVs couldn’t. As such, the need for intermediaries has been limited and content delivery improved. </p>
    <p class="w3-justify">Because of Netflix’s availability in over 190 nations, it is considered the world’s leading internet entertainment service, with 283 million paid memberships (Netflix, 2024). An issue faced by the streaming platform, however, is internet connectivity issues posed by unreliable infrastructures and socioeconomic barriers in rural areas. Netflix continues to be the most-streamed entertainment service regardless of these challenges though because they enforce solutions to such issues effectively, like offering various subscription plans to target lower-income brackets and partnering with regional internet service providers (ISPs) in an effort to build better infrastructures and increase internet penetration. For instance, in 2022, Netflix announced its Open Connect initiative, which involved installing content caching servers in Least Developed Countries (LDCs), Landlocked Developing Countries (LLDCs), and Small Island Developing States (SIDS) (Volmer, 2022).
    </p>
    <p class="w3-justify">Changes in lifestyle and advancements in technology are influencing customer preferences. In today's fast-paced society, busy lifestyles have become increasingly common.  For instance, the leading Filipino television series of 2023 and 2024, including “Can’t Buy Me Love,” “Pulang Araw,” “Lavender Fields,” and “Maria Clara at Ibarra,” are now available for streaming on Netflix.  This allows audiences to binge-watch their favorite shows at their convenience, without missing any episodes aired on Philippine television each night. </p>
    <p class="w3-justify">A notable feature of Netflix is that not only does it put TV series on the platform, but it also operates data analytics to give tailored recommendations. This only proves that the company is utilizing a significant advancement in technology that can transform consumer preferences. Audiences can now select content based on their preferred location, language, and genre. Netflix utilizes advanced algorithms to analyze this data and predict what viewers may enjoy next. This process includes examining users’ behavior by analyzing their viewing history, browsing history, and ratings of different content. This personalized approach keeps users engaged and satisfied, stimulating Netflix to reach out to producers, studios, or distributors with similar content to its most-watched shows and movies to license their movies and shows for the platform.
    </p>
    <p class="w3-justify">This kind of strategy that Netflix is practicing by showcasing a variety of popular series and movies from other countries enables a growing interest in international content that introduces viewers to diverse cultures and perspectives.</p>
